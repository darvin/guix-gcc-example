# MetaCall Guix GCC Example

This repository demonstrates how to use MetaCall Guix Docker Image for building portable self contained packages, in this case GCC@2.95.
The idea of this repository is to make a Proof of Concept for Blink Virtual Machine by usign GCC and possibly try to do the same with MetaCall in the future.
